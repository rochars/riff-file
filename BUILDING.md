# Building riff-file

Building works the same on all platforms:
```
npm run build
```
This will lint the sources, test the sources, compile the dist files version, test everything and generate the APID documentation.

There **should** be no errors or warnings during the build.

The dist files are generated in the *dist/* folder.

The API documentation is generated in the *docs/* folder.
